# 1.🚀  Movie Genre Prediction! 🎬
Using advanced machine learning techniques, I built models that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary. Here's a quick overview of what I used:

## 🔍 Models:

Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
## 🧠 Text Vectorization:

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): This technique helped transform movie plot summaries into numerical features, making them suitable for model training.# CODSOFT

# 2.💳Credit Card Fraud Detection

Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using data visualization and machine learning.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Tools: Seaborn
- **Transaction Analysis**: Visualized amounts and fraud occurrences.
- **Correlation and Distribution**: Explored key insights for modeling.

## Machine Learning Models

### Random Forest Classifier 🌳
- Used for predicting fraudulent transactions.
- Improved accuracy and robustness with ensemble learning.

### Decision Tree 🌲
- Explored for detecting fraud.
- Evaluated for effectiveness in identifying fraud patterns.

# 3.🚀 SMS spam detection! 🕵️

Here's what I used to tackle this challenge:
### - **Random Over Sampler** 
to handle dataset imbalance.
### - **Multinomial Naive Bayes** and **Gaussian Naive Bayes** 
for robust classification.
### - **TF-IDF Vectorizer** 
to convert text data into meaningful features.

These techniques combined significantly enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of spam detection.
