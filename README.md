# 🚀  Movie Genre Prediction! 🎬
Using advanced machine learning techniques, I built models that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary. Here's a quick overview of what I used:

🔍 Models:

Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
🧠 Text Vectorization:

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): This technique helped transform movie plot summaries into numerical features, making them suitable for model training.# CODSOFT
