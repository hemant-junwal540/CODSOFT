# 1.🚀  Movie Genre Prediction! 🎬
Using advanced machine learning techniques, I built models that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary. Here's a quick overview of what I used:

## 🔍 Models:

Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
## 🧠 Text Vectorization:

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): This technique helped transform movie plot summaries into numerical features, making them suitable for model training.# CODSOFT

# 2.💳Credit Card Fraud Detection

Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using data visualization and machine learning.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Tools: Seaborn
- **Transaction Analysis**: Visualized amounts and fraud occurrences.
- **Correlation and Distribution**: Explored key insights for modeling.

## Machine Learning Models

### Random Forest Classifier 🌳
- Used for predicting fraudulent transactions.
- Improved accuracy and robustness with ensemble learning.

### Decision Tree 🌲
- Explored for detecting fraud.
- Evaluated for effectiveness in identifying fraud patterns.

# 3.🚀 SMS spam detection! 🕵️

Here's what I used to tackle this challenge:
### - **Random Over Sampler** 
to handle dataset imbalance.
### - **Multinomial Naive Bayes** and **Gaussian Naive Bayes** 
for robust classification.
### - **TF-IDF Vectorizer** 
to convert text data into meaningful features.

These techniques combined significantly enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of spam detection.  

# 4.🚀Customer Churn Prediction🔍

Here's a brief overview of the models I used:

## 🌲 Decision Tree Classifier

Simple yet powerful, this model helps in understanding the decision rules and can be visualized easily. It creates a tree-like structure where nodes represent decisions based on customer features.

## 👥 K-Neighbors Classifier (KNN)

An intuitive model that predicts churn by comparing a customer's behavior to that of their 'neighbors' in the feature space. It's effective for small datasets and easy to interpret.

## 🌳 Random Forest Classifier

An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction. It's highly robust and reduces overfitting.

## 🚀 Gradient Boosting Classifier

Another ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, each new model correcting errors made by the previous ones. It is powerful for handling various types of data and achieving high accuracy.
